An easy Periodic Table app that'll help students to know all about elements specifications.
They can also see almost all possible reactions for each element with its formula and its benefit for us.
When the app is opened for the first time you will see a first time screen to show you how the app works. after that you can use the app.
When you single-click on any element you will see its specs in a nice look.
When you long-click on any element the rest of the elements will fade away except the ones that element can react with, after that when you click on any element of them you'll get the reaction equation and some information about it.
What makes this app unique is that its connected to an online database which means that we'll update it regularly and you'll see the new information we add immediately without the need to update the app itself.
